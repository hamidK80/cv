# Boiler Repair CV — Project Vision

## Purpose
- One-page, backendless CV to advertise a boiler/water-heater technician.
- Hosted on GitHub Pages, QR-friendly, ultra fast, and 100% mobile-first.

## Constraints
- No backend or user-generated content; static assets only.
- Angular standalone components, signals, OnPush, lazy sections.
- Keep code modular and tiny; reuse UI blocks.

## Sections (Single Page)
1. Hero: name/trade, value prop, tel/WhatsApp CTAs, subtle load animation.
2. About: photo, two-line origin story, quick credentials.
3. Core Services: 3–5 items with 1-line benefits, SVG icons.
4. How It Works: 3 steps (Request → Diagnose/Quote → Repair/Follow-up).
5. Toolbox Highlights: 4–6 cards; images + 1-line why-it-matters.
6. Tip of the Week: rotates on refresh via client-side random pick.
7. FAQ & Myth-Busters: 4–5 Q&A + one flip myth → truth.
8. Gallery (Before/After): 6–8 tiles with short captions.
9. Service Area & Contact: static SVG map, tel/mail links, mini mailto form.
10. Footer: anchor links, “Built with Angular • GitHub Pages”, LocalBusiness JSON-LD.

## Design Principles
- Bold, modern, high-contrast, large tap targets, thumb-friendly layout.
- Motion used sparingly (fade/slide), 60fps; prefers-reduced-motion respected.
- Image optimization and responsive sizes; icons as inline SVG.

## Performance & SEO
- Lighthouse 95+ mobile target; prefetch above-the-fold assets only.
- Structured data: LocalBusiness JSON-LD; semantic landmarks; meta tags.
- No blocking JS for non-critical effects; CSS first, JS minimal.

## Deployment
- GitHub Pages static hosting; base href set; no server features required.
- Cache headers via Pages defaults; versioned assets for updates.

## Success Criteria
- Instant load on mobile, clear CTAs, increased call/WhatsApp taps.
